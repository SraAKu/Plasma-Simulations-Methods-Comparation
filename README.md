# Plasma-Simulations-Methods-Comparation

On this repository you will find some algorithms for plasma simulations in C++, taking into account only the electroestatic forces between the charges of the system, and comparings of the perfomance of these algorithms.
Specifically the algorithms treated here are: Brute Force Algorithm (N square performance); Barnes-Hut Method (N*Log(N) performance) and Particle in Cell Algorithm (N Performance)
